This notebook focuses on time series forecasting using the Max Planck weather dataset. The Max Planck weather dataset is a collection of historical weather data that can be used for various analysis and forecasting tasks.

Dataset Description
The Max Planck weather dataset contains a comprehensive collection of weather measurements including temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and precipitation. The data is organized in a time series format, where each data point is associated with a specific timestamp.

The dataset includes the following variables:

Temperature: The measured temperature in degrees Celsius.
Humidity: The percentage of relative humidity.
Pressure: The atmospheric pressure in hPa (hectopascals).
Wind Speed: The wind speed in meters per second.
Precipitation: The amount of precipitation in millimeters.
